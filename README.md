# SoOpera

## 1. Modular and Extensible Design

### Component-Based Architecture:
- Divide the simulator into core functional modules: **Transmitter**, **Reflection/Scattering**, and **Receiver**.
- Maintain strict modularity, enabling independent updates or replacements of each module.

### Plug-and-Play Capability:
- Allow seamless substitution of different implementations for each module (e.g., swapping a GNSS transmitter with a cell tower transmitter).
- Ensure modules interact via well-defined, consistent interfaces.

### Support for Non-Orbital and Orbital Scenarios:
- Keep the architecture agnostic to specific transmitter/receiver platforms, allowing for scenarios with or without orbital dynamics.

## 2. Core Functional Modules

### a. Transmitter Module

#### Configurable Signal Properties:
- Define key parameters such as bandwidth, carrier frequency, number of channels, and modulation scheme.
- Support diverse signal types (e.g., GNSS, cellular, custom waveforms).

#### Platform Agnosticism:
- Allow transmitters to be placed on static towers, mobile ground vehicles, airborne platforms (e.g., drones, balloons), or spaceborne platforms.
- Include optional support for orbital motion (Earth or lunar), with ephemeris or dynamically computed trajectories as needed.

#### Multiplicity:
- Support multiple transmitters operating simultaneously with independent or synchronized configurations.

### b. Reflection/Scattering Module

#### Reflection Models:
- Implement models for specular, diffuse, and mixed reflections.
- Allow dynamic computation of reflection points based on platform geometry, surface characteristics, and environmental factors.

#### Surface Properties:
- Define reflection behavior based on material type (e.g., land, ocean, snow) and surface conditions (e.g., roughness, moisture).

#### Multi-Pass and Angular Variability:
- Simulate multi-pass reflections over the same geographic location, allowing for varying incidence and reflection angles.

### c. Receiver Module

#### Sensor Configuration:
- Define receiver characteristics, including bandwidth, noise floor, sensitivity, and dynamic range.
- Support multiple antennas with configurable locations and orientations.

#### Platform Agnosticism:
- Allow receivers to be placed on static (e.g., towers), mobile (e.g., vehicles, aircraft), or spaceborne platforms.
- Include optional support for orbital dynamics, such as ephemeris-based trajectories or real-time position updates for spaceborne receivers.

#### Backend Processing:
- Enable customization of backend signal processing (e.g., delay lines, filtering pipelines, multi-path handling).
- Ensure all processing culminates in high-fidelity bitstream generation.

## 3. Simulation Workflow and Data Flow

### Input Configuration:
- Use standardized input files (e.g., YAML, JSON) to define parameters for transmitters, receivers, and reflection environments.

### Processing Pipeline:

#### Initialization:
- Load configurations and initialize all modules (transmitter, receiver, and reflection environment).

#### Signal Propagation:
- Generate signals from the transmitter(s).
- Apply propagation effects based on reflection/scattering models and environmental conditions.

#### Reception and Processing:
- Capture and process signals at the receiver(s), applying configured backend processing steps.

#### Output Generation:
- Consolidate final bitstream outputs for all receiver configurations.

### Intermediate State Outputs:
- Provide optional outputs for intermediate results (e.g., specular points, link budgets) to enable analysis and debugging.

## 4. Abstraction and Encapsulation

### Unified Interfaces:
- Define explicit interfaces for each module to abstract implementation details.

### Configurable Abstractions:
- Abstract platform-specific details (e.g., stationary vs. mobile transmitters, airborne vs. orbital receivers) to ensure flexibility.

## 5. Computational Performance

### Parallelization and High-Performance Computing:
- Leverage multi-core CPUs and GPUs for intensive computations such as signal processing, link budgets, and reflection modeling.

### Batch Simulation:
- Support execution of multiple simulation scenarios simultaneously, ensuring high throughput.

### Scalability:
- Design the system to scale for large, complex simulations involving multiple transmitters, receivers, and environmental interactions.

### Resource Optimization:
- Optimize memory usage and computational resources to handle large-scale simulations efficiently.

## 6. Generic Platform Support

### Support for Non-Orbital Scenarios:
- Fully support scenarios without orbital dynamics, such as ground-based transmitters reflecting off Earth's surface to airborne receivers.

### Integrated Orbital Dynamics (Optional):
- Provide optional support for orbital computations within the transmitter and receiver modules, enabling:
  - Ephemeris-based or dynamically computed trajectories.
  - Perturbations (e.g., drag, solar pressure) when orbital scenarios are active.

generic SoOp simuator that's focused on the what if's. It's moduler

So the what if would be a ballon platform - grab all the GPS TLE"s. 
figure out specular point locations & sizes
do link budget.
simulate the analog front end and digital back end. 
Have the ability to do 1 or 2 antenans. 
have the ability to set up the back end for a bunch of different delays, etc.

But write it in a way it's moduler. 
so I can do flat earth if tower or low alt balloon
I can do some scattering model if needed
BUT it always comes back to a bitstream at an antenan(s) so we can do the retrevial.
